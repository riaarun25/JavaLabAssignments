# Java Lab Assignments
A repository to maintain Java Programming (CSE1007) lab assignments.

### Inheritance.java
Write a Java program to demonstrate the use of Inheritance.

### MultidimArray.java
Write a java program to demonstrate the use of multidimensional arrays and looping constraints.

### Stringhandling.java
Write a Java program to demonstrate the application of String handling functions.

### TrainingCentre.java
A training centre conducts a total of 7 tests for its students. Students are allowed to skip few tests. Let there be 25 students in the batch. So, in the main class for every student, read the number of tests taken and the marks scored in each test. A class ‘TestDetails’ should be defined with a 2D array of float type to store the marks of all the students. Define a method ‘storeMarks()’ that will receive the following details for every student from the main class and create in the 2D array, as many columns as equal to the number of tests, so as to store the marks. There is no need to store the number of tests. Define another method ‘displayMarks()’ to print the details. Also, the training centre wishes to keep those students in notice period who have taken < 3 tests and those who have not scored ≥ 50 in at least 3 tests. Derive another class ‘NoticePeriod’ from ‘TestDetails’ that includes a method to count and print the number of students in bench. Also, it should print the ID of those students assuming that the row index of the array to be their ID. While checking, do not proceed to check the marks in all tests, if the student has already scored more than 50 in 3 tests. Instantiate this class from the main class and do the required processing.
