# Java Lab Assignments
A repository to maintain Java Programming (CSE1007) lab assignments.

### - ExceptionHandling.java
Write a java program to demonstrate the use of java Exception handling methods.

### - FileHandling.java
Demonstrate with a program the use of File handling methods in Java.

### - Inheritance.java
Write a Java program to demonstrate the use of Inheritance.

### - MultidimArray.java
Write a java program to demonstrate the use of multidimensional arrays and looping constraints.

### - Numbers.java
Write  a  Java  program  to  find  the  average  of  n  numbers.  Use  the  input  through  the keyboard  during  run  time.  The  program  must  read the  value  of  n  first.  If  the  input  n happens to be zero or negative a suitable user-defined exceptions should be thrown. If itis  not  possible  to  convert  the  input  into  an  integer,  then  NumberFormatException must  be  throw.  Use  suitable  try-catch  blocks.  After  reading the n  value  successfully, youmust read the integer values of the array a[]. Each input string must be converted into an integer. So, use NumberFormatException appropriately

### - Shapes.java
Write a Java program to create an abstract class named Shape that contains two integers and  an  empty  method  named  print  Area().  Provide  three  classes  named  Rectangle, Triangle and Circle such that each one of the classes extends the class Shape. Each one of  the  classes  contains  only  the  method  print  Area() that  prints  the  area  of  the  given shape.

### - Stringhandling.java
Write a Java program to demonstrate the application of String handling functions.

### - ThreadsDisplay.java
Write a Java program that creates three threads. First thread displays “Good Morning” every one second, the second thread displays “Hello” every two seconds and the third thread displays “Welcome” every three seconds.

### - ThreadsExample.java
Write a program to demonstrate the use of threads in Java.

### - TrainingCentre.java
A training centre conducts a total of 7 tests for its students. Students are allowed to skip few tests. Let there be 25 students in the batch. So, in the main class for every student, read the number of tests taken and the marks scored in each test. A class ‘TestDetails’ should be defined with a 2D array of float type to store the marks of all the students. Define a method ‘storeMarks()’ that will receive the following details for every student from the main class and create in the 2D array, as many columns as equal to the number of tests, so as to store the marks. There is no need to store the number of tests. Define another method ‘displayMarks()’ to print the details. Also, the training centre wishes to keep those students in notice period who have taken < 3 tests and those who have not scored ≥ 50 in at least 3 tests. Derive another class ‘NoticePeriod’ from ‘TestDetails’ that includes a method to count and print the number of students in bench. Also, it should print the ID of those students assuming that the row index of the array to be their ID. While checking, do not proceed to check the marks in all tests, if the student has already scored more than 50 in 3 tests. Instantiate this class from the main class and do the required processing.

### - UserdefinedPackages.java
Write a Java program to demonstrate the application of user-defined packages and sub-packages.
